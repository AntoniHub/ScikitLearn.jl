Introduction
-------

The scikit-learn library has proven very popular with machine learning
researchers and data scientists in the last five years. It provides a uniform
interface for training and using models, as well as a set of tools for chaining
(pipelines), evaluating, and tuning model hyper-parameters. ScikitLearn.jl aims
to bring these capabilities to Julia.  Its primary goal is to integrate both
Julia- and Python-defined models together into the scikit-learn framework.
