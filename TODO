Re. Module loading: I don't have a great solution yet. I'm leaning towards
having a separate module for each main Python module
(eg. `sk_linear_model`). Or maybe I can @pyimport everything to make the
hierarchy work and use `@reexport`. `@require` is also interesting.

- Review docstrings
- Support Julia algos
- njobs>1
- More tests
- Deprecation warnings in Sk_Pipeline_PCA_Logistic.ipynb
- Random grid search
- Feature
- Dataframes

Before release

- Documentation
- Check with scikit re. name


More long-term

- JLD/Pickling (possibly by implementing JLD serialization for PyObjects
through pickling)
